## Taking the reigns
I was asked by the hugely talented and impossible to replace Karwai Pun, a senior interaction designer, and design lead for UCD Ops, if I would continue the amazing work she had led, in getting the design system live. I, of course couldnt refuse, despite the very large (and also probably small) shoes to fill. I relished helping lead the community of UCD-ers at the Home Office. I would take on standards work around the design system, being a makeshift community manager and getting the community to contribute.

## Supporting new starters
I was engaged by the UCD Ops team to take on the design segment of the intoduction for new starters. This meant helping define content, ensuring upto resources and information was passed to our new people when they joined the community, and also educating 'newbies' to how design is done and the importance of doing it right in government. I continued to be a helpful voice in the room by providing advice to those new the Home Office prototyping kit.


## Developing a contribution model

In late 2021, I facilitated a Blueprinting exercise which now forms the backbone of how people can engage and contribute to our standards. After which I published guidance on our contribution process, and have facilitated a patterns workshop with UCD to test the process itself. The output of this will be a published page of guidance available to the community on the [design system](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
