## Supporting new starters


## Engaging the design community

Having taken over from the previous design lead, I have led design system community work . This has involved pulling together people from user research, development, design, content, and accessibility to define our contribution model.

## Patterns
In late 2021, I facilitated a Blueprinting exercise which now forms the backbone of how people can engage and contribute to our standards. After which I published guidance on our contribution process, and have facilitated a patterns workshop with UCD to test the process itself. The output of this will be a published page of guidance available to the community on the [design system](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
