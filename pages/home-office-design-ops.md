## Taking the reigns
I was asked by the hugely talented and impossible to replace Karwai Pun, a senior interaction designer, and design lead for UCD Ops, if I would continue the amazing work she had led, on contributing to the design system, which by this point was [live already](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2021/10/25/making-our-design-system-a-useful-tool-for-teams/).  I, of course couldnt refuse, despite the very large shoes to fill. Having contributed previously to the [NHS service manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) I had expeience to lead updates to the design system,and to develop it further, promoting its use, and encouring contributions by the community. I would take on this work alongside my fulltime day to day squad delivery work, unassisted, and without direction.

## Supporting new starters
It was at this point, I was engaged by Karwai and the UCD Ops team to take on the design segment of the induction for new starters. This meant helping define content, ensuring upto date resources were referenced and information was passed onto our new people when they joined the community. I would  also be giving advice on how design is done and the importance of doing it right in a large government department. I continued to be a helpful voice in the community by providing advice to those new to the Home Office prototyping kit.

## Running workshops

Some time after, in late 2021,as part of the design systems work, I facilitated 2 seperate workshop exercises:

- Contribution blueprint
- Pattern workshop

The contribution model session had around 40 people take part, and involved looking at a 'to be' version of a what might be a typical user journey of somone wishing to contribute a pattern or component to the Home Office design system. Together we looked at phases, people, tools and governance.

### Its all about the community

Building on the contribution model, I wanted an example to use which would test the process, a nitty gritty design challenge everyone could relate to; I chose *'search'*, as this seemed to come up time after time as a pattern people needed help and guidance with. I then invited everyone to a remote, Mural based workshop, where we would discuss:

- Search examples from a service, with screenshots
- Common search based problems and solutions
- What guidance would be useful for those teams starting over
- What an MVP of guidance might look like

### Outputs and outcomes
With some priorities for the search pattern now firmly established, I set to work, gathering the fundamental basic requirements for the community.

These were:

- Fuzzy searching
- When to use search over another pattern
- Technical constraints
- Narrowing down / filtering
- Exact matches

I created a linked backlog item in the [design system](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/) where people can discuss the pattern for future iterations, and worked with Marion and Guerman, to help with content and accessibility on the guidance to be published. The result after several months of iteration and was published guidancence for [search for something](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/patterns/search-for-something)

## Building a proto-prototype kit
I have also, in January 2022, left behind a version of the Home Office prototype kit, based on the GOVUK kit, for use by the community. My hope is, this can be built upon by other designers and eventually hosted on the Home Office Github repository as an addition resource.
