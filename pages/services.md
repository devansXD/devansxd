## Designing products and services

I am Home Office assessment trained, and have worked against the GDS and NHS standard for 4 years, across massively complex landscapes. My work encompasses GDS and NHS design principles, working in tangent in multi disciplinary teams, both at the product and service level. 

- Prototyping
- Blueprinting and beyond
- Workshop facilitation
- Accessibility guidance and support


## Coaching and mentoring

I have now coached and mentored dozens of NHS Digital and Home Office colleagues in both basic user centred design practice, and prototyping methods. Iâ€™m proud to have grown UCD as a practice in incredibly large and complex organisations, and helped build the confidence of many junior designers.

## Building out UCD practice

I played a key part in identifying gaps in current resourcing and lead on the recruitment of designers at the Home Office. This involved working with the lead for UCD to identify and seek budget approval for new people, writing up the job descriptions with the Head of Role and liaising with HR to get these advertised externally. I have chaired and sifted for interview panels to ensure the process meets department guidelines and that candidates are assessed against professional standards.
