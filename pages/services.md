## Designing products and services

I create products and services that meet the needs of users. I have worked as a design lead in the public sector for 4 years and am passionate about embedding high standards of design across teams, growing talent, and delivering world class services and products to citizens and government users.

## Coaching and mentoring

I have now coached and mentored dozens of NHS Digital and Home Office colleagues in both basic user centred design practice, and prototyping methods. Iâ€™m proud to have grown UCD as a practice in incredibly large and complex organisations, and helped build the confidence of many junior designers.

## Building out UCD practice

I played a key part in identifying gaps in current resourcing and lead on the recruitment of designers at the Home Office. This involved working with the lead for UCD to identify and seek budget approval for new people, writing up the job descriptions with the Head of Role and liaising with HR to get these advertised externally. I have chaired and sifted for interview panels to ensure the process meets department guidelines and that candidates are assessed against professional standards.
