## Background to the service

The NHS cervical cancer screening service has a number of problem areas, namely, uptake by people of screening age, and ensuring they receive their results at the right address. I joined the team at the  intersection of discovery and alpha, due to time constraints on the project, as we needed to get  off the older clinical system as quickly as possible, and make the new system clinically safe and usable/more efficient.


## Forming, storming, norming
The research and design team were newly formed, and we were initially responding to research findings as best we could to iterate and test quickly.

## What we did
I ran a design workshop with several other designers and researchers to break down the user types and their respective tasks, this would enable us to focus on primary user needs and design for these first, helping product decisions to be made early on. This took the form of “which roles use the systems?” and “what do they do?”
I also then mapped these actions into 2 areas: system level actions, and patient level actions. Patient level being actions performed solely against a patients record. This would help us plan the information architecture.

## Design sprint
During lockdown we had been working remotely for 2 months, which represented challenges for collaboration; how to get agreement, and how to move forward collectively on assumptions to test.
To figure out what a first pass/ iteration might look like of the manage results flow, I ran a design sprint, remotely, with 10 team members, including  the  user researcher, product, BA, technical architects, and developers.
The outputs from this were an agreed service map, interaction flows to test, and some very hight level assumptions.

## Mapping it all out
I assisted the lead service designer, combining multiple blueprints we had of the to be service, and mapped those out in a way that was understandable for Public Health England, our main stakeholders.
The map would enable the research and design team to communicate the road map vision for live Beta, and bring PHE on board for quicker sign off of key milestone objectives.
I then led the design on several streams of work once themes and milestones had been defined by  product and BA team members.

## Standardisation
In December 2020, the NHS design system was still in its infancy, which meant there was very limited guidance around professional facing user interface standards. 
NHS Digital’s common user interface documentation, had been deprecated, as a result of work I had undertaken on a previous project, which would supersede the old standard and provide a modern responsive framework for sovereign posture systems. 
This meant we could reuse a lot of common patterns I had successfully implemented through testing with users, to form a basic structure for the new screening system. The majority of these patterns remained in place throughout the whole project.

### Screening role selection
I prototyped a way of allowing users to select a role before accessing the system, before being presented with access to parts of the system that were allowed based on a users smart card data.
This would replace a user having to login to old main frame systems upto 4 times every half an hour due to time out rules in the backend.
