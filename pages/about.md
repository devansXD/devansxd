I'm an interaction and service designer, based in North Leeds (Boston Spa) with my wife and son.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with my family, attempting to grow fruit and veg at my allotment, cycling and running around the roads of the surrounding [North Yorkshire countryside](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24997533), and photography.
