## What I'm doing now

I’ve just spent a year at the Home Office, helping build out design capability, grow UCD maturity, and assist delivery teams build the best products and services we can for users. Prior to that, I was an interaction designer for NHS Digital, across 2 large, complex clinical services. I have worked as a design lead in the public sector for 4 years and am passionate about embedding high standards of design across teams, growing potential in junior colleagues, and delivering world class services and products to citizens and civil servants.

## Coaching and mentoring

I have now coached and mentored dozens of NHS Digital and Home Office colleagues in both basic user centred design practice, and prototyping methods. I’m proud to have grown UCD as a practice in incredibly large and complex organisations, and helped build the confidence of many junior designers.

## Building out UCD practice

Having taken over from the previous UCD Ops lead at the Home Office, I led design system community work . This involved pulling together people from user research, development, design, content, and accessibility to define our contribution model. I facilitated a Blueprinting exercise which now forms the backbone of how people can engage and contribute to the standards. After which I published guidance on our contribution process, and have facilitated a patterns workshop with UCD to test the process itself. The output of this will be a published page of guidance available to the community on the design system. 

## My life

Based in North Leeds with my wife and son, I enjoy spending time with my family, attempting to grown fruit and veg at my allotment, cycling around the roads of the surrounding countryside, and photography.
